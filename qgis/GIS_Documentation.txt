# GIS Log - Sequence of Events to discuss in exercises

Documentation I took to perform exercise we will go over in workshop. This will form the skeleton 
of my lectures + walk through

GDAL ISSUE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35500176/importerror-no-module-named-gdal

Solved here: https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/docs/guides/gdal/

echo 'export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profilesource ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=/Users/nickbarber/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/osgeo:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

1) Required Software

Users need to install QGIS 3.10 (Stable release). To do this, they need to install other
software in a particular order. First, Python 3.8. Next, GDAL 3.1. Finally, QGIS 3.10

Some Python packages will need to be pre-installed. See QGIS installation instructions for details

Plugins needed: Easy Custom Labeling, Quick Map Services, Data Plotly, Globe Builder

2) Projection System

Need to definitively declare a PCS to perform computational tasks. I chose EPSG 31977 -
it's one of the preferred scientific PCS' for Ecuador. Uses Sistema de Referencia Geocentrico para las AmericaS 2000
tide-gauge controlled geodetic datum, and GRS ellipsoid. Accurate to 1m, appropriate for large to medium scale topographic 
mapping and engineering surveys. See: https://epsg.io/31977 for details

I set an EPSEG4326 (WGS84) to EPSG:31977 transform vector files:

+proj=pipeline +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=utm +zone=17 +south +ellps=GRS80

Raster files were tricky - needed to make a custom path in options to get them to work based on info from:

/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:

3) Vector setup

Needed to re-project all vectors using transformation in section 2. GeoRoc file needed to be
imported as a CSV, reprojected, saved as a geopackage, and re-added. CSVs are always annoying

4) Raster Setup: Raster files need to be re-projected, have holes filled, and merged

Only two SRTM 1-arc second files cover Quito area in Earth Explorer. These were exported as 
GeoTIFF files, and reprojected into the EPSG:31977 PCD of the project (from EPSG:4326)

Used Processing > SAGA > Raster Tools > Close Gaps

Output for each was saved as a Virtual Raster TIle (VRT) which cna later be merged with other VRTs

Merged using: 

Recolored as SingleBand pseudocolor
