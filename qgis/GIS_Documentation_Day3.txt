## QGIS Session 3: Advanced QGIS

Step 1: Manually create Georeferenced map & CSV from 1991 GP paper

Just show them the finished products

Step 2: Import GEOROC CSV

Show steps - import based on LAT_MIN, LONG_MIN

Then save as a shapefile

Then re-add shapefile

Step 3: Manually create sample points from 1991 paper

Point centroid on map selected. Assigned 3 fields - internal GIS ID, sample ID from paper,
sample name/comment from Table 2

Skipped adding points that only had measurements in Table 1

Step 4: Import non-referenced CSV from 1991 paper

Import as non-spatially defined CSVs. Null values left as empty fields

Step 5: Spatial Join

Right click on locs_COPY layer, select Joins, and add a new join. Join on sample Don't add a prefix.

Export joined shapefile as a new shapefile with prefix _hydrogeochem to make join 
permanent

Step 6: Validate to make sure data in right place.

Step 7: Perform IDW Interpolation 

inteprolated pH, set Vector layer = spring_hydrogeochem, attribute = pH, type = point, 
distance coeff = 2, extent = hydrogeochem layer, raster size with pixel X and Y = 1, saved to temporary file

Pixel size of 1 is way too high res - 10 at minimum next time

Step 8: Perform KDE Heatmap interpolation (optional)

Step 9: Python Script!!!!!

NEED TO READ THROUH PyQGIS developer cookbook to figure otu what I'm going to show. It's easier
to use the built in functionality in QGIS to make multiple IDW maps. So what's worth coding?


##END SECTION 1

Step 9: Road Layer - Introduction to Symbol Levels

Change symbol style to "Locked Roads"

Inspect and show problem with symbol

Enable "Symbol Layers" under advanced

Show that roads now look nice

Step 10: Draw Effects

Show off with GP point layer

- shadow
- inner glow
- eometry generator with buffer

Step 11: Point layer heatmap
