#Running Error Log

After updating to pPython 8 nd QGIS 10(Stable), QGIS required me to reinstall several python packages, including:

requests
osgeo
dateutil
owslib


Make sure you install Python 3.8, then GDAL new version, THEN QGIS 3.10
CHnage GRASS dependency manually
Add GDAL framework PATH manualy (Preferences --> ENvironment)
