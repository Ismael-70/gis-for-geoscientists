## QGIS Session 3: Advanced QGIS

### Advanced Calculations

Step 1: Manually create Georeferenced map & CSV from 1991 GP paper

Just show them the finished products

Step 2: Import GEOROC CSV

Show steps - import based on LAT_MIN, LONG_MIN

Then save as a shapefile

Then re-add shapefile

Step 3: Manually create sample points from 1991 paper

Point centroid on map selected. Assigned 3 fields - internal GIS ID, sample ID from paper,
sample name/comment from Table 2

Skipped adding points that only had measurements in Table 1

Step 4: Import non-referenced CSV from 1991 paper

Import as non-spatially defined CSVs. Null values left as empty fields

Step 5: Spatial Join

Right click on locs_COPY layer, select Joins, and add a new join. Join on sample Don't add a prefix.

Export joined shapefile as a new shapefile with prefix _hydrogeochem to make join 
permanent

Step 6: Validate to make sure data in right place.

Step 7: Perform IDW Interpolation 

inteprolated pH, set Vector layer = spring_hydrogeochem, attribute = pH, type = point, 
distance coeff = 2, extent = hydrogeochem layer, raster size with pixel X and Y = 1, saved to temporary file

Pixel size of 1 is way too high res - 10 at minimum next time

Step 8: Landslide risk example (see QGIS Training Manual)

Show simple model of landslide risk using our DEMs

Import raw rainfall data

Calculate slope Raster

COnvert rainfall data to right projection, then Rasterize (100x100, ecuador bounds)

Raster calculator (slope * rainfall)/100 = landslide risk

Zonal Statistics on ecu_popcensus and landlside risk

##END SECTION 1

##SECTION 2

Step 9: Road Layer - Introduction to Symbol Levels

Change symbol style to "Locked Roads"

Inspect and show problem with symbol

Enable "Symbol Layers" under advanced

Show that roads now look nice

Step 10: Draw Effects

Show off with GP point layer

- shadow
- inner glow
- geometry generator with buffer

Step 11: Point layer heatmap

Show off how to make this

Step 12: Raster Symbology

Show raw DEM

Close Gaps

Then show Hillshade tool in Processing toolbox

Create hillshade, and style with "Bilinear" Sampling

"Hard Light" rendering for pseudocolor layer

Overlay

Step 13: 3D Viewer

Open 3D viewer panel

Load topopgraphy data

Show output layout

### SECTION 3: More advanced calculations/data

Step 14: One geology spatial database connection:

1) WMS Connection: Canadian Natural Resouces

Create WMS connectrion with https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/752fe3fc-d871-5ae1-9bd9-2b6f65880a8d

2) WFS Connection

Smithsonian GVP

##Python

Step 15: Load world country layer with python script

script "load_vector.py"

Step 16: Buffer those countries

Script "buffer_countries.py"

Step 17: Introduce the PyQt5 and QGIS core API & Cookbook

Don't need to go over this in huge detail; better for them to explore themselves
