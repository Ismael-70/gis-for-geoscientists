## QGIS Session 4: Advanced QGIS

### Advanced Calculations

Task 1: Database Connections

1) XYZ Tiles - used to get access to basemaps. Show the range of basemaps you have enabled. 
Then share a few of the XYZ tile links to allow people to make these connections themselves. 
Use Google Satellite, Open Street Map as an example

2) WMS - explain what WMS does (limitations). Show BGS example and HTML link

3) WFS - Show Smithsonian GVP example

Why do we do this? What's the benefit? What have we learned?

Task 2: Model Builder

Create a Graphical model that allows our procedure in this exercise to be reproducible

4) Reproject --> Overalp --> Stats

Created a model script that lets me iteratively run the analytical procedure in Exercise 1 for a number of different hazards!

When discussing this, highlight the beenfits and limitations of the graphical modeler. 

Task 3: Pythin in QGIS

SHow simple Python script that allow us to import and manipulate some data

5) Discuss applications of Python in QGIS

6) Imported some data - both the popcensus layer (simple shapefile) and world map geopackage (Anita Grasser example)

7) Model builder Python output

Task 4: GEE

Explain what GEE is and why we would use it.

8) Import GEE layer using GEE Data Catalogue plugin

9) Run GEE script for global precipitation in Google Chrome

script in this case calculates cumulative rainfall over the whole planet for the year of 2017

10) Run GEE script in QGIS Python console

Reflec ton how this data could then be brought into QGIS for mapmaking/further manipualtion
