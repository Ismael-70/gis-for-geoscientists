# GIS Log - Sequence of Events to discuss in exercises

Documentation I took to perform exercise we will go over in workshop. This will form the skeleton 
of my lectures + walk through

GDAL ISSUE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35500176/importerror-no-module-named-gdal

Solved here: https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/docs/guides/gdal/

echo 'export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profilesource ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=/Users/nickbarber/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/osgeo:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

FOR WINDOWS:

Rather than the paths I recommend for Mac, you need to set a "Prepend," path in the 
Environments menu that corresponds roughly to the following. This should fix GDAL issues!

PYTHONPATH | C://ProgramFiles/QGIS3.10/apps/Python3.7/Scripts

Ref: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/33386

If Georeferencer is giving you issues, navigate to the following folder, and edit the
[plugins] header under the QGIS.ini text file: 

C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\QGIS

Set georefplugin=true under [plugins] near the bottom of the text file. 

Ref: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/332800/qgis-georeferencing-plugin-workaround

1) Required Software

Users need to install QGIS 3.10 (Stable release). To do this, they need to install other
software in a particular order. First, Python 3.8. Next, GDAL 3.1. Finally, QGIS 3.10

Some Python packages will need to be pre-installed. See QGIS installation instructions for details

Plugins needed: Easy Custom Labeling, Quick Map Services, Data Plotly, Globe Builder

2) Projection System

Need to definitively declare a PCS to perform computational tasks. I chose EPSG 31977 -
it's one of the preferred scientific PCS' for Ecuador. Uses Sistema de Referencia Geocentrico para las AmericaS 2000
tide-gauge controlled geodetic datum, and GRS ellipsoid. Accurate to 1m, appropriate for large to medium scale topographic 
mapping and engineering surveys. See: https://epsg.io/31977 for details

I set an EPSEG4326 (WGS84) to EPSG:31977 transform vector files:

+proj=pipeline +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=utm +zone=17 +south +ellps=GRS80

Raster files were tricky - needed to make a custom path in options to get them to work based on info from:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/276853/gdal-scripts-not-found-in-qgis-3-on-osx

/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:

3) Vector setup

Needed to re-project all vectors using transformation in section 2. GeoRoc file needed to be
imported as a CSV, reprojected, saved as a geopackage, and re-added. CSVs are always annoying

Kept PopulationCensus, TorrentRiver, Road, 3 admin lays (Level 1 2 and 3), coast

All reprojected and named "ecu_<appropriate suffix>".gpkg

4) Raster Setup: Raster files need to be re-projected, have holes filled, and merged

Only two SRTM 1-arc second files cover Quito area in Earth Explorer. These were exported as 
GeoTIFF files, and reprojected into the EPSG:31977 PCD of the project (from EPSG:4326)

Used Processing > SAGA > Raster Tools > Close Gaps

Output for each was saved as a Virtual Raster TIle (VRT) which cna later be merged with other VRTs

Merged using: GDAL Merge after coping old version of gdal_merge python file to 3.1 file

Recolored as SingleBand pseudocolor

/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:/Users/nickbarber/anaconda3/bin:/Users/nickbarber/anaconda3/condabin:/anaconda3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin

5) Georeference Basemap

https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/core_plugins/plugins_georeferencer.html
https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/georeferencing_basics.html

Load JPEG raster of map into Georefrencer tool without specifying a coordinate system (we don't know)

We want the map in our coordinate system (EPSG 31977), so we go to transformation settings 
and set that specified CRS< along with Thine Plate Spline transformation setting - from
experience Polynomial georefrencing can be way off. 

We also save the errors to an automatically generated OPDF report (ave to fix a name to this)
and name the georeferenced output. 

Next, we select control points - more than 5. I used obvious topographic features distributed 
evenly across the map. When residuals are calculated, you can stop, and hit Start Georeferencingg to 
export output. 

Save errors - all calculations with hazard need to take this into account

6) Tracing Basemap Features

Tracing lahars, and the outline of different ash fall isopachs

Tracing lahars between 1:10000 and 1:20000 scale

Tracing ash 30 mm @ 1:100000-250000 scale
^for 30 mm isopach, had to estimate western extent. Based on information in poster, 
I determined it had to encompass a few of the W-NW rivers (Google Satellite basemap), 
and stop short of the town of San Jacino del Bua. Formed a roughly ellipsoidal shape.

Tracing 90 mm ash isopach @ 1:75000

For lahar layer, had to clip out some bits. This is done using "Symmetrical Difference" tool

7) Calculating population vulnerable to secondary lahars

POPULATION_CENUSUS LAYER

EDA001-003 give population by major age groups (0-14, 14-65, 65+) in 2010. Sum these to give "POP"
field which gives the estimated population of each canton. 

Will try this with whole numbers, using attribute table "Create New Field"

New field called POP

Then use Statistics Viewer (Little Sigma) to determine sum of POP attribute in SELECTED AREA

8) Importing geochemical information (just for fun)

Import CSV file from GEOROC to show how to import CSV...fow now not touching this

9) Extracting topography/merging with volcanic information + hazards. 

Create a volcano point shape file based on hazard map location. Extract topographic info, 
population threatened, average geochemistry. 

Calculate % of Quito covered by lahars. Created stats output showing areas of population
affected by different hazards

Created dissolved shapefile with boundary of this affected area

Now need to calculate area covered by lahars, here and in Qutio. "Overlap Analysis"

Determine number of people impacted by different hazards in all, > 1,600,000 affected by 
historicla eruptions. you know this number by using the little sigma tool "Statistics,"
and then selecting "Selected Features Only," when looking into the "Sum" of the POP field
you defined earlier

RESULTS: 1.6 million people impacted by proximal hazards - > 2 million affected by ash.
~6% of surrounding municipalities will be covered by lahars, nearly 9% of Quito. That translates
to > 130,000 people directly threatened by lahars(assuming an even population distribution 
throughout the city)


10) Layout + Exporting 

Raster visualization --> Terrain Map View to make a beautiful underlying DEM

Created separate hillshade and pseudcolor to make for a more pleasing underlying terrain visualization
Resymbolized layers to show ash isopachs with different patterns, affected areas as multi-colored
border. THen made an "easy Custom Label" for GP and Quito. To keep these easy custom labels, 
downloaded "Memory Saver" Plugin. 

Used layout elements to add North Arrow, scale bar, inset map, legend, and text labels.

Exported as high res SVG, PDF, and PNG

***For custom labels, use memory saver plugin***
