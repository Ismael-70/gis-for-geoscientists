# Welcome to the Home page for the McGill University Society of Economic Geology (SEG) Student Chapter "GIS for Dummies" Workshop series!

This workshop is being presented online via Zoom, with the support of the McGill SEG Student Chapter. 

This web page will be a legacy reosurce to allow you to access the lectures, data, and outputs form the course, with the hope of making GIS accessible and useful in your earth science research. 

At the moment, the documentation/details are a bit sparse - bear with me as I develop these additional resources over the coming weeks. 

Feel free to get in touch with me at ndb38@cam.ac.uk if you have any questions. Cheers!
