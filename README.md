This workshop was first presented online via Zoom, with the support of the McGill SEG Student Chapter in June 2020. 

This page contains all the information you need to become a profient user of GIS for application in the earht sciences. This web page will be a legacy resource to allow you to access the lectures, data, and outputs form the course, with the hope of making GIS accessible and useful in your earth science research. 

This repo contains several folders. The first folder is a link to a separate repo, where the written exercise guide for Session 2 can be found. A similar link will be provided for Session 3 exercises (see task list for progress). Next, the "code" fodler incldued any scripts used in the exercises. The "lectrues" folder contains the relevant Powerpoint lectures and associated figures used in the live workshop presentations. The "planning" folder tracks current and planned workshops,a nd incldues unviersity specific plans for the course. The "qgis" folder is where most of the good stuff is: data, documentation, and maps. Everything you need to complete the exercises cna be found there!
