# Introduction

This workshop was first presented online via Zoom with the support of the McGill SEG Student Chapter in June 2020. 

This page contains all the information you need to become a profient user of GIS for applications in the earth sciences. This web page will be a legacy resource to allow you to access the lectures, data, and outputs form the course, with the hope of making GIS accessible and useful in your earth science research well after the workshop concludes. 

# Roadmap to the Repository

This repo contains several folders that house everything you'll need to get up and running. The first folder is a link to a separate repo, where the written exercise guide for Session 2 can be found. A similar link will be provided for Session 3 exercises (see task list for progress). Next, the "code" folder includes any scripts used in the exercises. The "lectures" folder contains the relevant Powerpoint lectures and associated figures used in the live workshop presentations. The "planning" folder tracks current and planned workshops, and incldues unviersity specific plans for the course. The "qgis" folder is where most of the good stuff is: data, documentation, and maps. Everything you need to complete the exercises can be found there!

This course is distributed under an MIT License. Feel free to share and use as you see fit, even if you haven't signed up for the course. I believe in the open sharing of knwoeldge and data. Though I offer the workshop for a fee, the underlying guides and information have no price tag or download limit. I do not claim any onwerhsip on the data used in these exercises, nor the images used in the presentations.

- [x] Populate with all data needed to perform tasks & documentation
- [x] Perform exercises myself; verify everything works
- [x] Complete UCL Workshop Series
- [ ] Finish Live Demo Guide
- [ ] Post citation list for images + data
- [ ] Add installation guide & resources
- [ ] Fill out GitHub Pages theme page

# Get in touch

Feel free to get in touch with me at ndb38@cam.ac.uk if you have any questions. I also maintain a website showcasing my work and past workshops using [Wordpress](https://volcannick.com). If there are any issues with the data or you'd like to offer a comment/correction, submit a pull request and I'll aim to respond to requests within 24 hours.

## Current Workshops

## Past workshops

1. McGill University, Montreal, Canada (Student Chapter of the Society of Economic Geology on campus). Reference: Catherine Crotty, Sarah Bodeving, and Robert Collar.
2. University College London, London, UK. Primarily organized for Natural Hazards stduents in the Department of Earth Sciences. Reference: Dr. Emma Liu.
"GIS for Geoscientists is to run in four session from August 10th to August 19th @ the UCL Department of Earth Sciences. Course partipants range in both prior GIS knowledge and career level, ranging from undergrad to faculty. In all, about 25 attendees are expected for the full workshop, which will run Monday and Wednesday afternoons for the next two weeks."

## Future Workshops

**If you'd like to run this workshop at your institution, please get in touch!** I'm excited to share my GIS knowledge, and I'm happy to customize the course to address your specific needs. Contact me for a quote!

Happy GIS-ing!
